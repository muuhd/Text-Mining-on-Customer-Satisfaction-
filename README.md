## **Insights**
Top 2 Strengths of Air India

1. Quality of food
   - Passengers praised the airline for the variety and excellent taste of meals on board

2. Satisfactory service
   - Passengers were pleased with the cabin crew, most notably their professionalism, courtesy and strong communication skills

Top 2 Weaknesses of Air India

1. Amenities
   - Passengers expressed unhappiness with the hygiene of the place and the maintenance of in-flight amenities, such as faulty entertainment screens and uncomfortable seating

2. Ground services
   - Passengers complained about rude/dismissive staff and poor lost luggage recovery

Recommendations

1. Building on their strengths
   -  Leverage their talent in flight meals by maintaining/improving the quality of food
   -  They could consider collaborating with renowned local chefs to enhance the dining experience on board
   -  Air India could also implement a reward system for the best flight crew to incentivise/recognise good service

   
3. Addressing weaknesses:
   -  Routine maintenance on cleanliness and in-flight amenities to ensure equipment is in working condition before flights
   -  Compulsory workshops for conflict resolution and communication to be attended by staff, with simulations to better prepare them in engaging passengers
   -  Air India could also explore a "Mystery Shopper" experiment where upper management staff travel anonymously to assess the service provided on the ground
   
## **Limitations of analysis**
- Small sample size may not be fully representative of the entirety of Air India reviews
- The sentiment analysis model may misclassify neutral reviews
